\title{Newton-Raphson method to fit SCAM}
\description{
This routine estimates SCAM coefficients given log smoothing parameters using the Newton-Raphson method.
The estimation of the smoothing parameters by the GCV/UBRE score optimization is outer to the model fitting. Routine 
\code{\link{gcv.ubre_grad}} evaluates the first derivatives of the smoothness selection scores with respect to the 
log smoothing parameters. Routine \code{\link{bfgs_gcv.ubre}} estimates the smoothing parameters using the BFGS method. 

The function is not normally called directly, but rather service routines for \code{\link{scam}}.

\usage{
scam.fit(G,sp, etastart=NULL, mustart=NULL, env=env, 
              null.coef=rep(0,ncol(G$X)), control=scam.control())
}

\arguments{
  \item{G}{A list of items needed to fit a SCAM.}

  \item{sp}{The vector of smoothing parameters.}

 % \item{gamma}{This constant allows to inflate the model degrees of freedom in the GCV or UBRE/AIC score.}  

 % \item{start}{Initial values for the model coefficients.}

  \item{etastart}{Initial values for the linear predictor.}

  \item{mustart}{Initial values for the expected values.}

  \item{env}{Get the enviroment for the model coefficients, their derivatives and the smoothing parameter.}

  \item{null.coef}{coefficients for a null model, needed for an ability to check for immediate divergence.}

  \item{control}{A list of fit control parameters returned by \code{scam.control}. It includes: \code{maxit}, a positive scalar which gives the maximum number of iterations for Newton's method; \code{devtol.fit}, a scalar giving the tolerance at which the relative penalized deviance is considered to be close enougth to 0 to terminate the algorithm;
      \code{steptol.fit}, a scalar giving the tolerance at which the scaled distance between two successive iterates is considered close enough to zero to terminate the algorithm; 
      \code{trace} turns on or off some de-bugging information;
      \code{print.warn}, when set to \code{FALSE} turns off printing warning messages for step halving under non-finite exponentiated coefficients,  non-finite deviance and/or if \code{mu} or \code{eta} are out of bounds.}
    
}
\details{
The routine applies step halving to any step that increases the
penalized deviance substantially.
