*** scam.fit1, scam.fit.post1: a new method is implemented to fit SCAM using a quasi-Newton method, the BFGS method (as an alternative to the Newton method) to minimize penalized deviance wrt model coefficients. This requires only first order derivatives of the log likelihood. The calculation of the edf and tr(A) is done once after fit, using analytical Hessian (taking 2nd order deriv of the log likelihood). The smoothing parameter is selected by efsudr.scam2() which requires the first derivatives of the deviance and tr(A) w.r.t. log(sp). Analytical (rather than approximate) expression of the Hessian is used here.

** efsudr.scam2: i) added extended Fellner-Schall method for regular families, with PIRLS/full-Newton method used for the coefficient estimation, performed by scam.fit(). Here only the first and the second order derivatives of the log likelihood are used when calculating the derivatives of the edf. The dependence of H on lambda is neglected.

* efsudr.scam: extended Fellner-Schall method now works for smoothing parameter selection by minimizing UBRE when scale parameter is known (as it is in the inner optimization). Also gcv expression in the efs update now includes the 'gamma' parameter. In this implementation the third order derivatives of the log likelihood are used when calculating the derivatives of the edf.

* small coding fixes with 'gamma' parameter as input argument of the fitting function; bug fixed in simulation example in predict.scam.Rd file. 

* estimate.scam: bug fixed with the call when the smoothing parameter is specified, which occurs with the newly introduced optimization method. Thanks to Pierre Masselot. Also small coding fixes when the sp is supplied: now the model fit is done within estimate.gam() function. 


1.2-13
* smooth.construct: added option of cyclic cubic regression spline ("cc") in the 'tesmd1', 'tesmd2', and 'tesmi2' smoothers as an alternative marginal basis along the otherwise unconstrained marginal smooth.

* plot.scam: bug fixed with plot methods for the smooths of the package mgcv, such as, Markov random fields bs="mrf", factor smooth interactions "fs", Gaussian process smooths bs="gp", splines on the sphere bs="sos", Duchon splines bs="ds". Thanks Alessia Eletti for reporting the bug. 


1.2-12
* smooth.construct: added option for cyclic cubic regression spline ("cc") in the 'tesmi1', tensor product bivariate smooth with increasing constraint in the first covariate. Thanks Eli Asarian for bringing this up.

*scam.fit: bug fixed with starting values of the model coefficients. Thanks Charlie Song for reporting the bug.
  

1.2-11 
* gcv.ubre_grad, scam.fit: bug fixed with vector dimensions when working with linear functional terms. Thanks to  
Paul Rosenfield for reporting the bug.

* summary.scam: corrections made when reporting results for parametric  factor terms.

* linear.functional.terms: shape constrained examples corrected, decreasing and increasing terms are now correctly specified using SCOP-splines without identifiability constraints (bs="mpdBy", bs="mpiBy"). An example with convex term is added (bs="cxBy"). Thanks to Paul Rosenfield for pointing out the bug.

* smooth.construct: added shape constrained smoothers: 'mpiBy', 'mpdBy', 'cxBy', 'cvBy', 'micxBy', 'micvBy', 'mdcxBy', 'mdcvBy' to be used with SCOP-splines with non-constant 'by' variable, and with linear functionals terms. In presence of non-constant 'by' variable the terms are fully identifiable, so they are left unconstrained (without imposing 'zero intercept' constraint). Thanks to Paul Rosenfield for pointing out the bug when 'cx' is used with linear functional terms.


1.2-10 
* plot.scam: now silently returns a list of plotting data in the same way as plot.gam(mgcv), to help users to produce customized plot. Thanks to Raphael Knevels.


1.2.9
* smooth.construct: added 'miso' smooth, a monotone increasing SCOP-spline with an additional 'start-at-zero' constraint, a smooth should be zero at the left-end point of the covariate range. Thanks to Sean Wu for bringing this up.

* smooth.construct: added 'mifo' smooth, a monotone increasing SCOP-spline with an additional 'finish-at-zero' constraint, a smooth should be zero at the right-end point of the covariate range. Care should be taken when using this smooth (see manual)

1.2-6

* An AR1 error model has been added. This can be used for the residuals of Gaussian-identity link models only. Standardized residuals (approximately uncorrelated under correct model) returned in 'std.rsd'.

* plot.scam: scop-spline smooths are now centred when being plotted to be in line with unconstrained smooths. Although 'zeroed intercept' constraint is applied to fit the scam model. 

* scam.fit: improved routine for SCAM coefficients estimation  via the Newton-Raphson method; step halving under non-finite deviance, checking convergence adequately, trace option for some de-bugging information, etc.

1.2-5

* estimate.scam: Extended Fellner-Schall optimizer for smoothing parameter selection is now available using scam(...,optimizer="efs") as in gam(mgcv). But rather than minimizing REML (in gam(mgcv)) it minimizes GCV criterion.

* bfgs_gcv.ubre: bug fixed to avoid zero eigenvalues. Thanks to Pierre Masselot for reporting the bug.


1.2-4

* scam.control: function added. This allows control of the numerical options for fitting a SCAM in the similar way as gam.control(mgcv). scam, scam.fit, estimate.scam, bfgs_gcv.ubre, gcv.ubre_grad, check.analytical routines were corrected to account for scam.control setting.

  plot.scam is now a clone of the 'new' version of plot.gam().

* predict.scam: type="iterms" is added to return standard errors for unconstrained smooth components that include the uncertainty about the intercept/overall mean ("iterms" was commented in an .Rd file of the previous versions but not implemented) 
Thanks to Ondřej Mikula for reporting the issue

* S3 methods predict.scam residuals.scam are registered now (in 'NAMESPACE' file)

* scam: corrected use of an 'offset' variable, the one that is outside of the formula. Previously it was not recognized by scam. Thanks to Amy Morin for reporting the bug and providing an example.

          argument to 'scam'. ('sp' values supplied to the smooth term 's' are ignored by 'scam')
          Thanks to Noel G. Cadigan for reporting the bug.

* References fixes in .Rd files



1.1-6

* Namespace, Description fixed

* scam: added additional returned elements of the fitted scam object: `aic', `df.residual', `df.null', `min.edf', object$call (needed for update to work), 'var.summary' (needed for vis.scam), `R', `edf1'.
   added keepData argument as input, if FALSE (default) the original data removed to save space. 
   removed object$X (model matrix) from return/output list to save space. model.matrix() added as in gam(), correspondingly summary.scam() and predict.scam() were corrected to replace object$X by model.matrix(object). 

* scam.fit: `Rrank' is now an exported object of mgcv 

* scam.check: added extra graphics parameters (...) to pass to plotting functions (like pch,cex);  added qqline() with colours in qqnorm() plot

* plot.scam: corrected number of plots per page and plotting any parametric terms when "all.terms=TRUE" as in plot.gam() (although plot.scam is based on the old version of plot.gam()).

* derivative.scam: this function replaced derivative.smooth(). It
works only for univariate smooths at the moment, with finite differencing approximations for unconstrained smooths.

* summary.scam: corrected the value of the adjusted R-sq as in gam(mgcv), fixed Ref.df to be the same as in summary.gam(),
  the code was corrected to be in line with summary.gam()

1.1-5

* Predict.matrix.**.smooth 

For all univariate and bivariate SCOP-splines Prediction method now allows prediction outside range of knots, and use linear extrapolation in this case

  large number of O(nq^2) products that were not needed removed, removal of multiple un-necessary loops.
